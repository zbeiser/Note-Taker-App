## Description

This application allows the user to enter notes from a webpage, save them for later use, and delete existing notes. It utilizes the express.js framework to build a backend that connects to the front end, allowing persistent data storage within a database file.

## Usage

Click the Get Started button upon opening the application to navigate to the Notes page. You can then enter a note title and body text. Once you've typed in both fields, click the save icon that appears in the upper right corner of the navbar to save the note to the database, its title appearing in the left column of the page. You can click on a note title to bring a read-only version of that note back up, as well as click the trash icon next to it to delete it. While viewing a previous note, you can click the plus icon in the upper right corner of the navbar to create a blank space for a new note.
